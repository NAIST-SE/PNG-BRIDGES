### We are back after the pandemic! The theme of the Workshop is "The Potential for Employment, Competency, and Global Engagement in Papua New Guinea"

## About
The objective of the International Workshop on BRIdging Divides with Globally Engineered Software (BRIDGES) is to foster development by providing a forum where researchers and practitioners can report on and discuss issues and solutions to bridge the digital divide of information within a practical geographic-free global software engineering setting.

The workshop encourages the exchange of ideas within the local and international community with its ultimate goal to make software engineering universal; for anyone, anywhere, without any technical, cultural and educational boundaries. This involves a round-table discussion with invited talks from both local and international participants.

## Venue
BRIDGES2023 will take place at Loloata resort, which is located on an island off the coast of Port Moresby, capital of Pacific nation, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Known as the land of unexpected, locals speak over 850 languages and have a diverse culture, flora and fauna (like the Bird of Paradise and the world's largest butterfly, the Queen Alexandra Birdwing), making PNG one of the last untouched locations on the planet. With independence day looming on September 16th, we expect the area to be buzzing with pacific-style culture and experiences. 

## International Talks

## Travel
To get to Port Moresby, the national airline, Air Niugini, operate weekly direct flights from the capital city to many domestic and international destinations including Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney, Brisbane, Cairns, Manila and Hong Kong. A visa is required to visit PNG, though passport holders from many countries are eligible for a 60-day visa on arrival for free at Port Moresby airport.
