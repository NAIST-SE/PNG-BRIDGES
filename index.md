## 2023 Theme: Pathways for Technology Employment, Competency, and Global Engagement from a Papua New Guinea Perspective
After the pandemic! This year theme of the Workshop is "Pathways for Tech, Big Tech, and Start-up Employment, Competency, and Global Engagement from a Papua New Guinea Perspective"
In this digital age of Artifical Inteligence (AI) in the cyberspace, emerging societies like Papua New Guinea have an opportunity to overcome the geographic, and social boundaries to engage with the global market.For this workshop, our idea is to bring experts and rising stars to the country to discuss the state of art. 

## BRIDGES Vision and Mission Statement
The objective of the International Workshop on BRIdging Divides with Globally Engineered Software (BRIDGES) is to foster development by providing a forum where researchers and practitioners can report on and discuss issues and solutions to bridge the digital divide of information within a practical geographic-free global software engineering setting.

The workshop encourages the exchange of ideas within the local and international community with its ultimate goal to make software engineering universal; for anyone, anywhere, without any technical, cultural and educational boundaries. This involves a round-table discussion with invited talks from both local and international participants.

## International Participants
**TBA**

## Local Participation
- Papua New Guinea Universities
- Papua New Guinea Science and Technology Secretariat
- Papua New Guinea Digital Cluster
- National High Schools
- PNG ICT Specialists

## Organizer
- Raula Gaikovina Kula (Organizer, Nara Institute of Science and Technology)

Due to limited space availability, DAY2 attendance at the workshop is by invitation only.

## Venue
BRIDGES2023 will take place at [Loloata resort](https://www.loloataislandresort.com/), which is located on an island off the coast of Port Moresby, capital of Pacific nation, Papua New Guinea (PNG). Known as the land of unexpected, locals speak over 850 languages and have a diverse culture, flora and fauna (like the Bird of Paradise and the world's largest butterfly, the Queen Alexandra Birdwing), making PNG one of the last untouched locations on the planet. With independence day looming on September 16th, we expect the area to be buzzing with pacific-style culture and experiences. 

## International Talks

**Coding in the Real World: Teaching Programming Through Open Source Collaboration**

<img align="right" height="200" src="https://ctreude.files.wordpress.com/2021/09/ctreude-1.jpg">

Abstract: Teaching programming often revolves around textbook examples, but what happens when students get to work on real, large-scale projects? In this talk, I will share my experience of teaching an Open Source course to a total of more than 500 students across five instances. This course allows students to contribute to actual Open Source Software development projects, immersing them in the world of coding, communication, and contribution processes that make real software come to life. I'll show examples of the work students have done, illustrating the connection between classroom learning and real-world programming. The course covers various aspects of working on large software projects, such as version control, online collaboration, and continuous software building. The main goals are to teach students practical communication skills in open source, help them understand how large projects function, and foster teamwork in programming. Assessments mirror real-life tasks, including activities like editing Wikipedia and reflecting on lessons learned, all while contributing to open source projects. I hope to inspire ways to make programming education more engaging and relevant, bridging the gap between academic study and the real world of software development.

**Towards Privacy Preserving Cross Project Defect Prediction with Federated Learning**

<img align="right" height="200" src="https://dong-w.github.io/images/wang_new_profile.png">

Abstract: Defect prediction models can predict defects in software projects, and many researchers study defect prediction models to assist debugging efforts in software development. In recent years, there has been growing interest in Cross Project Defect Prediction (CPDP), which predicts defects in a project using a defect prediction model learned from other projects’ data when there is insufficient data to construct a defect prediction model. Since CPDP uses other projects’ data, data privacy preservation is one of the most significant issues. However, prior CPDP studies still require data sharing among projects to train models, and do not fully consider protecting project confidentiality. To address this, we propose a CPDP model FLR employing federated learning, a distributed machine learning approach that does not require data sharing. We evaluate FLR, using 25 projects, to investigate its effectiveness and feature interpretation. Our key results show that first, FLR outperforms the existing privacy-preserving methods (i.e., LACE2). Meanwhile, the performance is relatively comparable to the conventional methods (e.g., supervised and unsupervised learning). Second, the results of the interpretation analysis show that scale-related features have a common effect on the prediction performance of the FLR. In addition, further insights demonstrate that parameters of federated learning (e.g., learning rates and the number of clients) also play a role in the performance. This study is served as a first step to confirm the feasibility of the employment of federated learning in CPDP to ensure privacy preservation and lays the groundwork for future research on applying other machine learning models to federated learning.

Dong Wang is an Assistant Professor from the Principles of Software engineering and programming Languages Lab (POSL) at Kyushu University, Japan. Dong received dotoral degree from Nara Institute of Science and Technology under the supervision of Prof. Kenichi Matsumoto (Software Engineering Laboratory). Research goals are to directly uncover empirical evidence and extract knowledge from data recorded in software repositories. His research topics mainly focus on understanding and improving developer collaboration practices such as code review settings and various communication channels.

## Travel
To get to Port Moresby, the national airline, Air Niugini, operate weekly direct flights from the capital city to many domestic and international destinations including Singapore, Tokyo, Sydney, Brisbane, Cairns, Manila and Hong Kong. A visa is required to visit PNG, though passport holders from many countries are eligible for a 60-day visa on arrival for free at Port Moresby airport.
